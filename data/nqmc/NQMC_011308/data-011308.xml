      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level risk-standardized complication rate (RSCR) following an elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and/or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The outcome (complication) is defined as any one of the specified complications occurring up to 90 days following the start of the index admission. The hospital that performed the procedure is the one held accountable for the measure outcome (complication or no complication). </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="21" ordby="90" id="568" name="Rationale" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are commonly performed procedures that improve quality of life. In 2003 there were 202,500 THAs and 402,100 TKAs performed (Kurtz et al., &quot;Projections,&quot; 2007) and the number of procedures performed has increased steadily over the past decade (Kurtz et al., &quot;Future,&quot; 2007; Ong et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Although these procedures dramatically improve quality of life, they are costly. In 2005 annual hospital charges totaled $3.95 billion and $7.42 billion for primary THA and TKA, respectively (Kurtz et al., &quot;Future,&quot; 2007). These costs are projected to increase by 340% to $17.4 billion for THA and by 450% to $40.8 billion for TKA by 2015 (Kurtz et al., &quot;Future,&quot; 2007). Medicare is the single largest payer for these procedures, covering approximately two-thirds of all THAs and TKAs performed in the U.S. (Ong et al., 2006). Combined, THA and TKA procedures account for the largest procedural cost in the Medicare budget (Bozic et al., 2008). </p>
<p>Because these are commonly performed and costly procedures, it is imperative to address quality of care. Complications increase costs associated with THA and TKA and affect the quality, and potentially quantity, of life for patients. Although complications following elective THA and TKA are rare, the results can be devastating. Rates for periprosthetic joint infection following THA and TKA range from 1.6% to 2.3%, depending upon the population (Bongartz et al., 2008; Kurtz et al., 2010). Reported 90-day death rates following THA range from 0.7% (Soohoo et al., 2010) to 2.7% (Cram et al., 2007). Rates for pulmonary embolism following TKA range from 0.5% to 0.9% (Cram et al., 2007; Mahomed et al., 2003; Khatod et al., 2008; Solomon et al., 2006). Rates for wound infection in Medicare population-based studies vary between 0.3% and 1.0% (Cram et al., 2007; Mahomed et al., 2003; Solomon et al., 2006). Rates for septicemia range from 0.1%, during the index admission (Browne et al., 2010) to 0.3%, 90 days following discharge for primary TKA (Cram et al., 2007). Rates for bleeding and hematoma following TKA range from 0.94% (Browne et al., 2010) to 1.7% (Huddleston et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Furthermore, hospitals vary in their rate of complications. Analyses in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients (2008 to 2010) demonstrate a median hospital-level risk-standardized complication rate (RSCR) of 3.5% (range 1.8% to 8.9%) after elective primary THA and/or TKA, suggesting room for improvement in clinical care.</p>
<p>The variation in complication rates across hospitals suggests there are considerable differences in the quality of care at the hospital level. Measuring and reporting risk-standardized complications rates will inform health care providers about opportunities to improve care, strengthen incentives for quality improvement, and promote improvements in the quality of care received by patients and the outcomes they experience. The measure will also provide patients with information that could guide their choices regarding where they seek care for these elective procedures. Furthermore, the measure will increase transparency for consumers and has the potential to lower health care costs due to costly readmissions associated with these complications.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2010, there were 168,000 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and 385,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) performed on Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2010). Although these procedures dramatically improve quality of life, they are costly. In 2005, annual hospital charges totaled $3.95 billion and $7.42 billion for primary THA and TKA, respectively (Kurtz et al., 2007). These costs are projected to increase by 340% to 17.4 billion for THA and by 450% to 40.8 billion for TKA by 2015 (Kurtz et al., 2007).

<p>Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a comprehensive view of quality of care that reflects complex aspects of care such as communication between providers and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment. These aspects are critical to patient outcomes, and are broader than what can be captured by individual process of care measures.</p>
<p>The THA/TKA hospital-specific risk-standardized complication rate (RSCR) measure is thus intended to inform quality-of-care improvement efforts, as individual process-based performance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes. </p></div>"/>

<p>The total hip arthroplasty (THA)/total knee arthroplasty (TKA) complication measure estimates hospital-specific risk-standardized complication rates (RSCRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the model, using April 2013 to March 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year. </p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics for assessing model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero. </p>
<p>The results of these analyses for the measure are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>THA/TKA Complication 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of THA/TKA Model Variables </em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. There were no large changes (greater than 2% absolute change) in the frequencies. However, the increases in frequencies of Morbid obesity and Renal failure observed in 2016 public reporting continue, but only by 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively, over the three-year period. </p>
<p><em>THA/TKA Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the THA/TKA complication model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.65.</p></div>"/>

The outcome for this measure is any complication occurring during the index admission (not coded present on arrival) to 90 days post-date of the index admission.</p>
<p>Complications are counted in the measure only if they occur during the index hospital admission or during a readmission. The measure defines a &quot;complication&quot; as: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia, or sepsis/septicemia/shock during the index admission or a subsequent inpatient admission that occurs within seven days from the start of the index admission; </li>
    <li>Surgical site bleeding or pulmonary embolism during the index admission or a subsequent inpatient admission within 30 days from the start of the index admission; </li>
    <li>Death during the index admission or within 30 days from the start of the index admission; or, </li>
    <li>Mechanical complication or periprosthetic joint infection/wound infection during the index admission or a subsequent inpatient admission that occurs within 90 days from the start of the index admission. </li>
</ul>
<p>The risk-standardized complication rate (RSCR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; admissions with a complication to the number of &quot;expected&quot; admissions with a complication at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed complication rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of admissions with a complication within 90 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case mix.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome. </p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>The outcome for this measure is any one of the specified complications occurring during the index admission or during a readmission except for deaths, which can occur anywhere as long as it is within 30 days of the start of the index admission. The measure assesses a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient experiences one or more of the complications defined above. Therefore, if a patient experiences one or more complications in the applicable time period, the outcome variable is coded as a &quot;yes.&quot; </p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables </strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission. </p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment. </p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum's (NQF's) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) complication rate is higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the model are similar with and without the addition of these variables. </p>
