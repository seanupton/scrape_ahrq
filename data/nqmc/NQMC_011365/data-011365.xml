      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>A brain computed tomography (CT) is often ordered in addition to a sinus CT because headache is a common symptom related to sinusitis; however, simultaneous CT sinus and brain imaging for headache without suspected complications is generally considered inappropriate (AIM Specialty Health, 2014; Jordan et al., 2009) as the imaging field for a brain CT contains large portions of the sinuses (AIM Specialty Health, 2014); performing both procedures is duplicative and results in inefficiency and lower quality care. Beyond concerns of efficiency and cost, there may be safety concerns to a patient undergoing two scans. A CT of the head has a typical effective radiation dose of approximately 2.3 milliSieverts (mSv), equivalent to approximately 115 chest X-rays. A CT of the paranasal sinuses and maxillofacial area is equivalent to approximately 50 chest X-rays (1 mSv) (American Imaging Management, 2012). </p></div>"/>

Brain computed tomography (CT) studies</p>
<p><em>Initial Patient Population</em>: This measure applies only to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in original, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare who were treated as outpatients in hospital facilities reimbursed through the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). These measures do not include Medicare managed care beneficiaries, non-Medicare patients, or beneficiaries who were admitted to the hospital as inpatients.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries included in the measure's initial patient population had documentation of a brain CT performed within a one-year window of claims data. Beneficiaries can be included in the measure's initial patient population multiple times; each brain CT performed at a facility measured by OPPS is counted once in the measure's denominator.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Beneficiaries who have a clinical diagnosis of one or more conditions for which imaging is considered appropriate are excluded from the measure. </p>
<p>For this measure, beneficiaries whose brain CT had one of these four clinical diagnoses recorded on the claim are excluded from the measure's initial patient population; these conditions include cancer, trauma, orbital cellulitis, or intracranial abscess. For all four groups of conditions, clinical evidence exists (within a practice guideline or the peer-reviewed literature) that indicates performing a brain CT followed immediately by a sinus CT may be appropriate care. Consequently, any beneficiary with one or more of these conditions is excluded from the measure.</p>
