    <li>The 5-year survival rate for all cancers diagnosed between 2003 and 2009 is 68%; however, survival statistics vary greatly by cancer type and stage at diagnosis. In 2014, an estimated 585,720 people in the U.S. will die from cancer, including 9,750 people in Minnesota. </li>
    <li>Survival has improved substantially over the past decades for individuals diagnosed with certain types of cancer, in part due to advances in chemotherapy and radiation therapy. </li>
    <li>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that the over-all costs of cancer in 2009 were $216.6 billion: $86.6 billion for direct medical costs and $130.0 billion for indirect mortality costs (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2014). </li>
    <li>Annually, over 1.1 million individuals in the U.S. are estimated to receive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for cancer. Of these individuals, approximately 650,000 receive chemotherapy, 643,000 receive radiation, and 180,000 receive both during a year (Halpern &amp;amp; Yabroff, 2008). </li>
    <li>The risk of being diagnosed with cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring in adults who are middle aged or older. Approximately 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed in people 55 years of age and older. In the U.S., men have slightly less than a 1 in 2 lifetime risk of developing cancer over the course of a lifetime and women have a little more than a 1 in 3 risk (ACS, 2014). </li>
    <li>Of those patients being treated, there is fairly even distribution by gender and the following age groups: less than 55 years, 55 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older. The majority of treated patients are non-Hispanic white, which reflects the prevalence estimates. Other racial/ethnic groups identified in the treatment estimates include blacks and Hispanics, representing 10% and 6% respectively (Halpern &amp;amp; Yabroff, 2008). </li>
