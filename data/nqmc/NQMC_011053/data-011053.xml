<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statement</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All patients must be screened for pain at each contact. </li>
    <li>Pain intensity must be quantified and quality must be characterized by the patient (whenever possible based on patient communication capacity). </li>
    <li>Comprehensive pain assessment must be performed if new or worsening pain is present and regularly performed for persisting pain. </li>
    <li>If necessary, get additional information for family/ caregiver regarding pain and impact of function (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2015). </li>
</ul>
<p>Various methods and tools exist to assess pain severity. Intensity of pain should be quantified using a numerical rating scale (i.e., 0 to 10), visual analog scale, categorical scale, or pictorial scale (e.g., The Faces Pain Rating Scale) (NCCN, 2015).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), to ensure the <em>Oncology: Medical and Radiation &amp;ndash; Pain Intensity Quantified</em> measure was reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing chart data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Five sites participated in the testing of the measures. Two sites were in urban settings, two sites were in suburban settings, and one had multiple practice sites in urban, rural and suburban settings. Site A was a hospital-based practice with 21 physicians. Site B was a physician-owned private practice with four physicians. Site C was a physician-owned private practice with 41 physicians. Site D was an academic practice with nine physicians. Site E was an academic practice with 14 physicians. </p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Oncology: Medical and Radiation &amp;ndash; Pain Intensity Quantified</em></p>
<p>There were 862 observations from five sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 862 observations that were initially selected, 862 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.990 demonstrates almost perfect agreement between reviewers. </p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)</span><br />
Denominator: 862, 100.00%, (0.990 (0.970-1.000))<br />
Numerator: 862, 99.99%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)*<br />
Exceptions: Not applicable, Not applicable, Not applicable</p>
<p>This measure demonstrates perfect reliability, as shown in results from the above analysis. </p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p></div>"/>

    <li>This measure is an episode-of-care measure; the level of analysis for this measure is every visit for patients with a diagnosis of cancer who are also receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the measurement period. For patients receiving radiation therapy, pain intensity should be quantified at each radiation treatment management encounter. For patients receiving chemotherapy, pain intensity should be quantified at each face-to-face encounter with the physician while the patient is receiving treatment. For purposes of calculating this measure, eligible encounters for patients receiving chemotherapy will include those encounters where the patient has been administered chemotherapy within 30 days prior to the encounter and also been administered chemotherapy within 30 days after the date of the encounter. For example, at every visit for patients with a diagnosis of cancer who are also receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the patient should have pain intensity quantified. </li>
    <li>Pain intensity should be quantified using a standard instrument, such as a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, visual analog scale, a categorical scale, or the pictorial scale. Examples include the Faces Pain Rating Scale and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). </li>
