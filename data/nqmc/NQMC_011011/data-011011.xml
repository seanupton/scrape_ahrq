<p>This measure is to be reported at <span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>each denominator eligible visit</span> occurring during the performance period ending November 30th for melanoma patients seen during the performance period. It is anticipated that eligible clinicians providing care for patients with melanoma will submit this measure.</p>
<p>There are two reporting criteria for this measure:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>All visits for patients, regardless of age, diagnosed with a new occurrence of melanoma during excision of malignant lesion <br />

    <li>All visits for patients, regardless of age, diagnosed with a new occurrence of melanoma evaluated in an outpatient setting </li>
</ol>
<p>Although this measure contains two reporting criteria, there is <strong>only</strong> one reporting rate and one performance rate for this measure.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Perceived lack of follow-up with primary care providers is reinforced in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on patient errors (Institute of Medicine Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, 1999). The intention of this measure is to enable the primary care provider to support, facilitate, and coordinate the care of the patient.</p>
<p>Deficits in communication have clearly been shown to adversely affect post-discharge care transitions. A recent summary of the literature found that direct communication between hospital physicians and primary care physicians occurs infrequently (in 3% to 20% of cases studied), the availability of a discharge summary at the first post-discharge visit is low (12% to 34%) and did not improve greatly even after 4 weeks (51% to 77%), affecting the quality of care in approximately 25% of follow-up visits. This systematic review of the literature also found that discharge summaries often lack important information such as diagnostic test results, treatment or hospital course, discharge medications, test results pending at discharge, patient or family counseling, and follow-up plans (Kripalani et al., 2007).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Recommendation Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>Each local skin cancer multidisciplinary team (LSMDT) and specialist skin cancer multidisciplinary team (SSMDT) should have at least one skin cancer clinical nurse specialist (CNS) who will play a leading role in supporting patients and caregivers. There should be equity of access to information and support regardless of where the care is delivered. A checklist may be used by healthcare professionals to remind them to give patients and caregivers the information they need in an appropriate format for pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and palliative care. This may also include a copy of the letter confirming the diagnosis and treatment plan sent by the consultant to the general practitioner (GP).</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Provide a rapid referral service for patients who require specialist management through the LSMDT/SSMDT. </li>
    <li>Be responsible for the provision of information, advice and support for patients managed in primary care and their caregivers. </li>
    <li>Maintain a register of all patients treated, whose care should be part of a regular audit presented to the LSMDT/SSMDT. </li>
    <li>Liaise and communicate with all members of the skin cancer site-specific network group. </li>
    <li>Ensure that referring GPs are given prompt and full information about their patients' diagnosis or treatment in line with national standards on communication to GPs of cancer diagnoses. </li>
    <li>Collect data for network-wide audit (National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2006). </li>
</ul>
<p>Communication and information exchange between the medical home and the receiving provider should occur in an amount of time that will allow the receiving provider to effectively treat the patient. This communication and information exchange should ideally occur whenever patients are at a transition of care, e.g., at discharge from the inpatient setting. The timeliness of this communication should be consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and, in the case of a patient being discharged, the urgency of the follow-up required. Communication and information exchange between the MD and other physicians may be in the form of a call, voicemail, fax or other secure, private, and accessible means including mutual access to an electronic health record (EHR).</p>
<p>The Transitions of Care Consensus Conference (TOCCC) proposed a minimal set of data elements that should always be part of the transition record and be part of any initial implementation of this standard. That list includes the following: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Principal diagnosis and problem list </li>
    <li>Medication list (reconciliation) including over the counter/herbals, allergies and drug interactions </li>
    <li>Clearly identifies the medical home/transferring coordinating physician/institution and their contact information </li>
    <li>Patient's cognitive status </li>
    <li>Test results/pending results </li>
</ul>
<p>The TOCCC recommended the following additional elements that should be included in an 'ideal transition record' in addition to the above: </p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Emergency plan and contact number and person </li>
    <li>Treatment and diagnostic plan </li>
    <li>Prognosis and goals of care </li>
    <li>Advance directives, power of attorney, consent </li>
    <li>Planned interventions, durable medical equipment, wound care, etc. </li>
    <li>Assessment of caregiver status </li>
    <li>Patients and/or their family/caregivers must receive, understand and be encouraged to participate in the development of their transition record which should take into consideration the patient's health literacy, insurance status and be culturally sensitive (Snow et al., 2009). </li>

<p><em>Face Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Face validity of the measure score was assessed for three of the four melanoma measures.

<p>After the measure was fully specified, the expert panel was asked to rate their agreement with the following statement: &quot;The scores obtained from the measure, as specified, will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability testing (i.e., manual review of the patient medical record by two trained clinical abstractors and comparison of their individual findings) was conducted at three dermatology practice sites on three of the four melanoma measures (i.e., measures 2, 3 and 4). These sites represent various types, locations, and sizes. Kappa statistics were calculated at the data element level for the denominator, numerator and exceptions categories. Data element reliability was established based on the results of this analysis. </p>
<p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em></p>
<p>The PCPI measure testing project revealed that the data elements for measure 2 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability, the data elements for measure 3 demonstrated fair to almost perfect reliability and the data elements for measure 4 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability in the numerator category. </p></div>"/>
