<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2012 total Medicare expenditures were $574.2 billion, representing 3.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). Current estimates suggest that Medicare spending will increase to 5.6% of GDP by 2035 due to both an increase in the Medicare population as well as Medicare spending on each beneficiary (The Boards of Trustees, Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, 2013). The growth in Medicare spending is unsustainable and highlights the need to create incentives for high value care. A critical first step in moving toward high value care is to define an approach to calculate costs that is transparent to consumers and fair to providers. This measure, using standardized payments, reflects differences in the management of care for patients with heart failure (HF) both during hospitalization and immediately post-discharge. </p>
<p>Payments, however, are difficult to interpret in isolation. Some high payment hospitals may have better clinical outcomes when compared with low payment hospitals; other high payment hospitals may not. In an effort to identify practice patterns that may be expensive without conferring a quality benefit, the HF payment measure specifications are aligned with current quality of care measures such as the Center for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) 30-day HF risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR). In this way the measure can facilitate the profiling of hospital value and encourage the most efficient delivery of high quality care.</p>
<p>A payment measure that fairly profiles hospitals by adjusting for hospital case-mix and standardizes payments for geography is congruent with national efforts to increase the transparency of our healthcare system. Although the HF payment measure is not intended to be used in payment programs, when interpreted in the context of CMS's 30-day HF RSMR, it can provide key insights into those systems of care that provide high value as a patient moves from the inpatient to the outpatient setting. Because the payment measure spans an episode of care, it is complementary to and may uniquely inform innovative payment models such as bundled payments and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), both of which seek to improve healthcare value by optimizing the coordination of care across care settings (CMS, 2013).</p>
<p>Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalization for Americans 65 and over and costs roughly $34 billion annually (Russo &amp;amp; Elixhauser, 2006; Heidenreich et al., 2011). It is a common condition in the elderly with a substantial range in payments due to different practice patterns. Furthermore, because 30-day all-cause mortality and readmission measures for HF are already publicly reported, HF serves as a model condition for assessing relative value for an episode of care that begins with an acute hospitalization. By focusing on one specific condition, value assessments may provide actionable feedback to CMS and hospitals to incentivize targeted improvements in care.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Heart failure (HF) is a common condition in the elderly with substantial variability in payments due to different practice patterns. Quality measures for HF such as 30-day HF risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) are already publicly reported. In the context of its publicly reported quality measures, HF is an ideal condition in which to assess payments for Medicare patients and relative hospital value. Therefore, we created a measure of payments for a 30-day episode of care for HF that could be aligned with the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid's (CMS's) 30-day HF mortality and readmission measures. This will allow CMS to assess the value of care provided for these episodes.</p>
<p>A preliminary examination of the 30-day HF risk-standardized mortality and risk-standardized payment measures showed high quality care (as measured by RSMR) at higher and lower relative costs. This finding illustrated that quality care can be provided at relative lower costs and that efficiencies of care can be optimized for HF. </p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models </strong></p>
<p>The heart failure (HF) payment measure estimates hospital-specific episode-of-care risk-standardized payment (RSPs) using a hierarchical generalized linear model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the HF model using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year. </p>
<p>CMS assessed generalized linear model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. Two summary statistics for assessing model performance were computed: the predictive ratio and a quasi-R&amp;sup2;. For a traditional linear model (that is, ordinary least squares regression), R&amp;sup2; is interpreted as the amount of variation in the observed outcome that is explained by the predictor variables (patient-level risk factors). Generalized linear models, however, do not output an R&amp;sup2; that is akin to the R&amp;sup2; of a traditional linear model. A &quot;quasi-R&amp;sup2;&quot; was produced by regressing the total payment outcome on the predicted outcome. Specifically, CMS regressed the total payment on the payment predicted by the patient-level risk factors.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.3 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>HF Payment 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of HF Model Variables </em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include increases in Other psychiatric disorders (20.3% to 22.7%), Respiratory arrest/cardiorespiratory failure/respirator dependence (27.8% to 31.2%), and Renal failure (61.1% to 63.3%). </p>
<p><em>HF Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.3.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical generalized linear regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.3.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted payment ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the HF payment model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. The quasi-R&amp;sup2; for the HF payment model was 0.03, suggesting that approximately 3% of the variation in payment can be explained by patient-level risk factors. This quasi-R&amp;sup2; is in line with R&amp;sup2;s from other patient-level risk-adjustment models for healthcare payment (Pope et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the quasi-R&amp;sup2; and predictive ratios remained similar to the model used for 2016 public reporting.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables </strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid disease, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission. </p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment. </p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important payment differences. As part of the National Quality Forum's (NQF's) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although bivariate analyses found that the average total payments is higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the quasi-R&amp;sup2; values for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables. </p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D in the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission. </p></div>"/>
