      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>As readmission following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is likely a signal of perioperative complications and suboptimal transitional care, the readmission measure offers the additional benefit of illuminating areas for improvements for hospitals, in order to minimize medical and surgical complications during surgery and the postoperative period, and improving the care provided in the transition to outpatient settings. The premise is that improved quality of care, including coordination and communication among providers, patients, and their caregivers, can favorably influence performance on these measures.</p>
<p>High readmission rates and wide variation in these rates suggest that there is room for improvement. Reducing readmissions after CABG surgery has been identified as a target for quality measurement. An all-cause readmission measure for patients who undergo CABG surgery will provide hospitals with an incentive to reduce readmissions through prevention and/or early recognition and treatment of postoperative complications, and improved coordination of peri-operative care and discharge planning.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2007, the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC) published a report to Congress in which it identified the seven conditions associated with the most costly potentially preventable readmissions in the United States (U.S.). Among these seven, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) ranked as having the highest potentially preventable readmission rate within 15 days following discharge (13.5%) as well as the second highest average Medicare payment per readmission ($8,136) (MedPAC 2007). The annual cost to Medicare for potentially preventable CABG readmissions was estimated at $151 million.</p>

An all-cause readmission measure for patients who undergo CABG surgery will provide hospitals with an incentive to reduce readmissions through prevention and/or early recognition and treatment of postoperative complications, and improved coordination of peri-operative care and discharge planning. Finally, CABG surgery has been identified as a potential applicable condition for use in the Affordable Care Act's Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. </p></div>"/>

<p>The coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) readmission measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the model using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Readmission 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of CABG Surgery Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over measurement period. There were no notable changes (greater than 2% absolute change) in the frequencies.</p>
<p><em>CABG Surgery Model Parameters and Performance</em></p>
<p>Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the CABG surgery readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.64.</p>

This measure assesses unplanned readmissions, from any cause, within 30 days the date of discharge from the index coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) admission.</p>
<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>The hospital-specific risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; readmissions to the number of &quot;expected&quot; readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. The &quot;numerator&quot; of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identified admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of procedures and conditions to operationalize these principles and to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href=&quot;https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;amp;cid=1219069855841&quot; title=&quot;QualityNet Web site&quot;>2017 Procedure-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em>.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
