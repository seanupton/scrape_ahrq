Mortality is defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the start of the index admission.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The goal of this measure is to improve patient outcomes by providing patients, physicians, and hospitals with information about hospital-level, risk-standardized mortality rates following hospitalization for acute ischemic stroke. Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a broad view of quality of care that encompasses more than what can be captured by individual process-of-care measures. Complex and critical aspects of care, such as communication between providers, prevention of, and response to, complications, patient safety and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment, all contribute to patient outcomes but are difficult to measure by individual process measures (Krumholz et al., 2007; Bradley et al., 2006). The goal of outcomes measurement is to risk-adjust for patients' conditions at the time of hospital admission and then evaluate patient outcomes. This mortality measure was developed to identify institutions whose performance is better or worse than would be expected based on their patient case-mix, and therefore promote hospital quality improvement and better inform consumers about care quality. </p>
<p>Stroke can be a sudden and devastating disease and, in a small proportion of cases, may result in patients being so disabled and debilitated that they and their families elect to not continue aggressive treatment. In such cases the best quality care may ultimately be that which supports patients' goals and comfort at the end of life rather than that which prolongs life. The intent of a mortality rate is not to convey that all deaths are the result of poor care. The goal is not to have zero deaths. The premise is that there are preventable deaths. Knowledge of how an institution performs compared with what might be expected given their case mix is helpful in encouraging efforts to improve outcomes.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The stroke measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models, using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year. </p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero. </p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.6 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>Stroke Mortality 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of Stroke Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include a decrease in Other musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (70.4% to 67.1%).</p>
<p><em>Stroke Model Parameters and Performance</em> </p>
<p>Table 4.6.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.6.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the stroke mortality model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic increased slightly from 0.74 to 0.75. </p>

The measure counts death from any cause within 30 days of the start of the index admission.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; deaths to the number of &quot;expected&quot; deaths at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed mortality rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of deaths within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case mix.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measures to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. </p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission. </p></div>"/>
