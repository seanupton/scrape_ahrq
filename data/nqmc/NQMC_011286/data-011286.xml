<p>The &quot;Discharge Information&quot; composite measure is based on two questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey that ask patients:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>During this hospital stay, did doctors, nurses or other hospital staff talk with you about whether you would have the help you needed when you left the hospital? </li>
    <li>During this hospital stay, did you get information in writing about what symptoms or health problems to look out for after you left the hospital? </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey, better known as HCAHPS, is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care. </p>
<p>The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care. </p>
<p>Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS Survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) developed a draft CAHPS Hospital Survey (HCAHPS) instrument and submitted it to the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) on January 15, 2003. The draft instrument was subsequently refined based on a multi-step process that included consumer testing, additional stakeholder and public input, a CMS directed three state pilot test, and additional field testing. </p>
<p><em><em>HCAHPS Three State Pilot Test</em></em></p>
<p>CMS pilot tested the January 15, 2003 version of the HCAHPS instrument through a contract with the Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) in three states (Arizona, Maryland, and New York) (CAHPS II Investigators &amp;amp; AHRQ, 2003). The pilot test included 132 hospitals and resulted in over 19,000 completed surveys. Testing began in June 2003 and ended in August 2003. The results of the CMS pilot test were utilized to refine the survey instrument (Westat, 2005). Following the pilot in these three states, the survey instrument was tested in Connecticut as an additional test state.</p>
<p><em>Focus Groups</em></p>
<p>AHRQ and CMS conducted six focus groups with consumers in October 2003 and another 10 in March 2004. These focus groups, conducted in four cities, included adults who had a recent experience in a hospital or were a caregiver for someone who had been in the hospital. Information obtained from the focus groups was used to further refine the survey instrument.</p>
<p><em>Additional Field Testing</em></p>
<p>Over a 6-month period beginning in fall 2003, AHRQ tested the instrument in five volunteer sites encompassing over 375 hospitals:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Calgary Health Region </li>
    <li>California Institute for Health System Performance </li>
    <li>California Regions of Kaiser Permanente </li>
    <li>Massachusetts General Hospital, and </li>
    <li>Premier Incorporated </li>
</ul>
<p>The CAHPS team used these field tests to learn more about the hospital survey implementation process, including the survey instrument, sampling processes, data collection processes, and other related issues (AHRQ, 2004).</p>
<p><em>Pre-implementation Testing</em></p>
<p>In the summer of 2004, AHRQ provided an opportunity for hospitals and survey vendors to test the current instrument on their own. The purpose of this test was to help identify ways to minimize the potential burden and disruption posed by the integration of the HCAHPS survey into existing survey efforts. Through these test sites, researchers formally and scientifically investigated various approaches to integrating the survey items with existing questionnaires, as well as alternative protocols for administering the survey.</p></div>"/>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>18 years or older at the time of admission </li>
    <li>Admission includes at least one overnight stay in the hospital
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>An overnight stay is defined as an inpatient admission in which the patient's admission date is different from the patient's discharge date. The admission need not be 24 hours in length. For example, a patient had an overnight stay if he or she was admitted at 11:00 PM on Day 1, and discharged at 10:00 AM on Day 2. Patients who did not have an overnight stay should not be included in the sample frame (e.g., patients who were admitted for a short period of time solely for observation; patients admitted for same day diagnostic tests as part of outpatient care). </li>

    </li>
    <li>Alive at the time of discharge </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: The basic sampling procedure for HCAHPS entails drawing a random sample of all eligible discharges from a hospital on a monthly basis. Sampling may be conducted either continuously throughout the month or at the end of the month, as long as a random sample is generated from the entire month. If the hospital/survey vendor chooses to sample continuously, each sample must be drawn using the same sampling ratio (for instance 25 percent of eligible discharges or every fourth eligible discharge) and the same sampling timeframe (for instance, every 24 hours, 48 hours, week, etc.) throughout the month. Refer to the &quot;CAHPS&amp;reg; Hospital Survey (HCAHPS). Quality Assurance Guidelines. Version 12.0&quot; for additional information (see the &quot;Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>

    <li>Patients with a foreign home address (the United States [U.S.] territories &amp;ndash; Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands &amp;ndash; are not considered foreign addresses and therefore are not excluded) </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>One of the methodological issues associated with making comparisons between hospitals is the need to adjust appropriately for patient-mix differences, survey mode, and non-response. Patient-mix refers to patient characteristics that are not under the control of the hospital that may affect measures of patient experiences, such as demographic characteristics and health status. The basic goal of adjusting for patient-mix is to estimate how different hospitals would be rated if they all provided care to comparable groups of patients.</p>
<p>Before public reporting hospital results, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) adjusts for patient characteristics that affect ratings and are differentially distributed across hospitals. Most of the patient-mix items are included in the &quot;About You&quot; section of the instrument, while others are from administrative records. Based on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (HCAHPS) mode experiment and pilot data, and consistent with previous studies of patient-mix adjustment in CAHPS and in previous hospital patient surveys, we use the following variables in the patient-mix adjustment model:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Type of service (medical, surgical, maternity care) </li>
    <li>Age (specified as a categorical variable) </li>
    <li>Education (specified as a linear variable) </li>
    <li>Self-reported general health status (specified as a linear variable) </li>
    <li>Response percentile (length of time between discharge and completion of survey) </li>
    <li>Language spoken at home (English, Spanish, Chinese, or Russian/Vietnamese/Other) </li>
    <li>Interaction of age by service </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the data are adjusted for patient-mix, there is a fixed adjustment for each of the reported measures for mode of administration (mail, telephone, mail with telephone follow-up, and active Interactive Voice Recognition). The patient-mix adjustment uses a regression methodology also referred to as covariance adjustment.</p>
