      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a priority area for outcomes measure development because it is a common, debilitating condition associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. To better assess hospital care and care transitions for COPD patients, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has contracted with Yale New Haven Health Services Corporation/Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (YNHHSC/CORE) to develop a hospital-level readmission measure for patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of COPD.</p>
<p>Hospital readmission is an important outcome for patients, as it is disruptive to patients and caregivers, costly to the healthcare system, and puts patients at additional risk of hospital-acquired infections and complications. Research has shown that readmission rates are influenced by the quality of inpatient and outpatient care, as well as hospital system characteristics, such as the bed capacity of the local healthcare system (Fisher et al., 1994). In addition, specific hospital processes such as discharge planning (Sharma et al., 2011), medication reconciliation, and coordination of outpatient care have been shown to affect readmission rates (Nelson, Maruish, &amp;amp; Axler, 2000).</p>
<p>Outcome measures can focus attention on a broad set of healthcare activities that affect patients' well-being. Moreover, improving patient outcomes is the ultimate goal of quality improvement, so outcomes are a direct measure of success in quality improvement.</p>
<p>Measuring and reporting readmission rates will inform healthcare providers about opportunities to improve care, strengthen incentives for quality improvement, and ultimately improve the quality of care received by Medicare patients. Improvements in care transitions for this condition are likely to reduce costly readmissions.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2007, the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC) published a report to Congress in which it identified the seven conditions associated with the most costly potentially preventable readmissions. Among these seven, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranked fourth (MedPAC, 2007). COPD is a leading cause of readmissions to the hospital (Jencks et al., 2009). The 30-day readmission rate among patients hospitalized for COPD, from 2003 to 2004, is 22.6%, accounting for 4% of all 30-day readmissions (Jencks et al., 2009).</p>
<p>The Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) has also identified COPD as an ambulatory-care-sensitive condition (ACSC). ACSCs are conditions for which good outpatient care can potentially prevent the need for hospitalization or for which early intervention can prevent complications or more severe disease (AHRQ, 2007). COPD is an ASCS that is associated with high readmission rates and high costs to Medicare (MedPAC, 2007). These facts underscore the need for developing strategies to reduce readmissions and subsequent costs associated with COPD admissions. COPD patients require ongoing care and treatment after discharge and are therefore at increased risk for readmission.</p>
<p>Although many current hospital interventions are known to decrease the risk of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge (Leppin et al., 2014; Benbassat &amp;amp; Taragin, 2000; Naylor et al., 1999; Coleman et al., 2006), current process-based performance measures, cannot capture all the ways that care within the hospital might influence outcomes. Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a comprehensive view of quality of care that reflects complex aspects of care, such as communication between providers and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment. These aspects are critical to patient outcomes, and are broader than what can be captured by individual process-of-care measures.</p>
<p>The COPD hospital-specific, risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) measure is thus intended to inform quality-of-care improvement efforts, as individual process-based performance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes. As a result, many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that allow patients and providers to assess relative outcomes performance for hospitals (Krumholz et al., 2007). Improvement in inpatient care and care transitions for this common, costly condition are likely to reduce costly readmissions.</p>
<p>Early experience with care bundles suggests that that appropriate (guideline recommended care), high-quality, and timely treatment for COPD patients can reduce the risk of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge (Hopkinson et al., 2012). Studies of integrated care management after hospitals discharge have suggested clinical benefit (Casas et al., 2006; Prieto-Centurion et al., 2014). Recent evidence of declining readmission rates provides further support for the concept that efforts to improve transitional care can affect a patient's risk of readmission. </p></div>"/>

<p>The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) readmission measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.3 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>COPD Readmission 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of COPD Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include increases in Anxiety disorders (6.1% to 8.2%), Cardio-respiratory failure and shock (39.5% to 44.4%), Other psychiatric disorders (33.0% to 35.6%), and Renal failure (33.2% to 35.3%).</p>
<p><em>COPD Model Parameters and Performance</em></p>
<p>Table 4.3.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.3.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the COPD readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.64.</p>

The measure assesses unplanned readmissions to an acute care hospital, from any cause, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an index chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admission.</p>
<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; readmissions to the number of &quot;expected&quot; readmissions at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>See the <em><a href=&quot;https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;amp;cid=1219069855841&quot; title=&quot;QualityNet Web site&quot;>2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identified admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href=&quot;https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;amp;cid=1219069855841&quot; title=&quot;QualityNet Web site&quot;>2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-Level 30-Day Risk-Standardized Readmission Measures</a></em>.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measures to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.</p></div>"/>
